Demo testing in Django
==========================

This is the example project demonstrating how to go about testing from the
`blog series`_ on the topic. It adds tests to the perennial "`polls`_" app
from the Django tutorial (minus the generic views).

Tags have been added for each step in the process, starting with ``01-initial``.
The project is based on Django 1.8 & SQLite.

For the admin:

* **Username:** admin

Using with python3.4 and django 1.8
